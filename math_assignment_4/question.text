Problem Set: Finding the Angle w in the Given Triangle
Problem Statement:
Task:
Calculate the value of w using the properties of isosceles triangles and the fact that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degree.
Steps to Solve:
Identify the Isosceles Triangle Properties:
The triangle shown is isosceles, meaning two sides are equal, and the base angles are also equal.
Let the two base angles of the triangle be w each (since base angles in an isosceles triangle are equal).
Sum of the Angles in a Triangle:
The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degree∘. This gives us the equation:

Simplifying the equation:

Solving for w:
Subtract 24 degree∘ from both sides:


Conclusion:
The value of the angle w is 78 degree.

Final Answer:
The size of the angle w is 78 degree
