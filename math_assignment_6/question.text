Problem : Surface area of a cylinder
Problem Statement:
To calculate the surface area of a cylinder in Python, you'll need to know the formula for the surface area of a cylinder, which is given by:

where:
r is the radius of the cylinder's base.
h is the height of the cylinder.
π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
Explanation:
Importing math Module: We import the math module to access the value of π\piπ.
Function Definition: We define a function cylinder_surface_area that takes radius and height as parameters and returns the surface area.
Input: The program prompts the user to enter the radius and height.
Output: It calculates the surface area and prints it formatted to two decimal places.
